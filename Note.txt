I would like to have the first version be a command line program. 
This means I can access all functions via text prompts. 

It should be clean and profesional. Properly formated 
1. doesn't crash
2. has all needed data
    a. keys
    b. message
    c. etc
3. basic easy to use commands
    a. encrypt
    b. decrypt
    c. generate keys
    d. etc
